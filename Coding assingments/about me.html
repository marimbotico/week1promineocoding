        <section>
        <p> A native of Costa Rica, I moved to the U.S.A. to pursue my dream of becoming a professional percussionist. 
            I have been playing percussion for the past 25 years now and was lucky to attend the best conservatories 
            and schools in the nation. I am a proud alumni of the Interlochen Arts Academy, Oberlin Conservatory of 
            Music, Boston University and Lynn Conservatory. I have performed side by side with members of the best 
            orchestras in the world ranging from the Chicago Symphony to the Berlin Philharmonic.

            I am an endorsed artist from the Avedis Zildjian Family as well as the Remo Inc. Family. 
            As a teacher and facilitator, I have been bringing the drum workshop idea to retirement communities, 
            after school music programs and churches. </p>
